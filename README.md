# Wizard5e
Simple GUI tool allowing users to look up various spells that can be used by a wizard in D&D 5E.  Displays spell name, llevel, school, and description.
Tool is currently incomplete and only contains a small sample of spells.

Currently in progress:
-Completing database of spells
-Cleaning up GUI

Other Possible Ideas:
-May expand application to be a full D&D 5E spell database tool
